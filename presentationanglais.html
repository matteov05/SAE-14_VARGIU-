    <header>Who am I ?</header>
    <p>My name is VARGIU Matteo, I'm 18, I live in Alsace and I'm passionate about aviation and travelling. I study in the University of Colmar and I do a Bachelor in networks and telecommunications. I decided to do this formation primarily because I like IT in general, but also because I really like the alternating option.
